    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>Is my credit card information secure?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Spring's payment processor is Stripe, a secure PCI Level One compliant service provider. Spring never touches your payment information or holds any sensitive information. Once an order has been placed, Stripe then requests authorization from your bank. Your account will not be charged until your order has shipped.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>Why was I charged multiple times?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Spring is partnered with Stripe, a secure PCI level one compliant service provider to process payments.  When you place an order, Stripe will request authorization from your bank. You will not be charged until your order has shipped. Stripe will reauthorize your credit card every 6 days until your order ships, which is why you may see a second charge on your account. Not to worry, this pending charge will fall off shortly!
        Stripe will stop reauthorizing your card as soon as your item ships.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>When will I receive my refund?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Because we are a marketplace, brands on Spring set their own return policy. Therefore, the refund processing time may vary by brand.
        Contact <a href='mailto:concierge@shopspring.com'>'mailto:concierge@shopspring.com'</a> and we will request an update on your refund status immediately.

      <h3 class='question'>How can I find and follow brands on Spring?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        This is one of our favorite features. There are hundreds of brands to love and discover in three easy steps:
        BRANDS
        1. For iPhone, tap the ‚ÄòBrands‚Äô tab at the bottom of your Spring screen. For Android, tap the left menu navigation and select ‚ÄòBrands.‚Äô
        2. Search by brand name or explore brands by category.
        3. When you see a brand that you want to follow, simply tap the plus button next to the brand's name.
        If you want to see more from any brand, tap on the brand name to visit their Spring Shop. Tap the 'Follow' button in the brand's Spring Shop to add them to your personalized feed 
        BROWSE
        You can also discover new brands in the Browse tab, where you can explore by category from all brands on Spring - whether or not you follow them.
        You can tap into any post to learn more about the product and tap the brand logo to visit their Spring Shop and 'Follow' them.
        If you can‚Äôt find a brand you are looking for, they might not yet be Spring. But we'd love to know about them! Send an email to brandrequest@shopspring.com - discovering new brands is one of our favorite things to do.

      <h3 class='question'>How can I find a specific product?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        There are a few ways to find a product on Spring:
        1. If you know the brand name, tap the 'Brands' tab and search for the brand by name.  Click into their Spring Shop by tapping on their logo, and browse all the products to find the one you're looking for.
        2. You can also browse products by category. Simply go to the 'Browse' tab and select from Women‚Äôs, Men‚Äôs, Lifestyle or Beauty, then select the product category and browse all products available in that category.
        If you don‚Äôt see the product you're looking for, the brand may not have posted it on Spring. Shoot us a note at Spring Concierge with the brand name, product name, and any other information and we‚Äôll try to track it down for you!

To see your loved items you've saved, tap the 'ME' section on your iPhone, or the 'My Loves' tab on your Android.
