  <ul class='limit mt6 mb4 qa'>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>What is Spring?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Spring is a mobile app that enables you to shop and discover more than 850 amazing brands in one place, with free shipping on everything. 
        <br/>
        Shopping on Spring is personal. You follow brands to keep up with sales and new arrivals, and we’ll send you recommendations to help you discover more cool stuff.
        <br/>
        When you purchase an item on Spring, you buy it directly from the brand, and the brand ships your item right to you. Spring doesn’t hold any inventory or make any products — we just play matchmaker and do our best to make shopping spectacularly fun and easy for you.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>How can I get Spring?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Download the Spring app on the <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id899156093' target='_blank'>App Store</a> and <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jellolabs.spring.android&referrer=ts%3Da88e8db1-37de-11e5-945a-f23c91505711' target='_blank'>Google Play</a>. Spring is currently available for iOS and Android devices.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>Do I have to pay to use Spring?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Nope! Like the best things in life, Spring is free. (Buying things does cost money, however.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>I'm a brand and I want to sell on Spring — can I join too?</h3>

      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Guest mode is a way to preview Spring without creating an account. You can browse items in guest mode, but you must join Spring to make a purchase. 
        <br/>
        And you should join Spring! You’ll get all kinds of wonderful benefits, including sale alerts and great recommendations. Plus your feed will be filled with new arrivals and amazing items from brands you follow.

  <ul class='limit mt6 mb4 qa'>
<li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>How do I buy my first item?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        When you find an item you want to purchase, tap “Buy,” enter your shipping and payment information, then just swipe to pay. Be on the lookout for an email from Spring confirming your purchase. Your shipping and payment information will be saved to make future purchases easy.
      </p>
    </li>
<li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>Can I save items for later? </h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Yes! To save an item on Spring, simply tap the heart icon or double-tap the photo. To see your loved items, tap “Me” on your iOS device or “My Loves” on your Android. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>When will my order arrive?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        When you purchase an item on Spring, you are placing an order directly with the brand. Each brand has its own shipping method, so the most accurate answer to “When will my order arrive?” is: It depends.
        <br/>
        When you place an order, you will receive a confirmation email from Spring with an estimated arrival date. You can view your order status, shipping method, and estimated arrival date anytime by selecting an order in the “Me” tab on your iOS device, or in the left navigation menu under “Orders” on your Android device. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>When will you charge my credit card?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Spring will charge your credit card when your order has shipped. You may see a pending charge on your account before shipment, but Spring will not capture payment until your order is sent out.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>Can I modify my order before it is shipped?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        If you would like to change your order before it ships, please send an email to <a href='mailto:concierge@shopspring.com'>concierge@shopspring.com</a> and a member of our team will work with the brand to accommodate your request. If your item has already shipped, Spring Concierge will facilitate a quick and easy return.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>How do I cancel my order?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        To cancel your order, please send an email to <a href='mailto:concierge@shopspring.com'>concierge@shopspring.com</a> and a member of our team will work with the brand to cancel your order before shipment. If your item has already shipped, Spring Concierge will facilitate a quick and easy return, provided that your item is return-eligible.
      </p>
    </li>
<li class='mt2'>
  <h3 class='question'>How do I check out with multiple items?</h3>
  <p class='answer mt1'>
    On Spring you can purchase only one item at a time. By design, we do not have a shopping cart. That’s because we want to make shopping as quick and easy as possible.
    <br/>
    To purchase several different items, you must swipe to pay on each one individually. If you would like to order more than one of a particular item, you can tap “Review Order” at checkout and increase the quantity.
    <br/>
    To save an item for later, love it by tapping the heart icon or double-tapping the image. The item will be saved to your “Me” tab on your iOS device, or your “My Loves” tab on Android. Revisit your Loves later and you can purchase a loved item with just a swipe.
  </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>Where can I find my order number?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Once you place an order, you can find all your order information — including your order number — in the “My Orders” section of the “Me” tab on your iOS device, or by tapping “Orders” in the left navigation menu on your Android. You will find the order number in the top right hand corner. You can also view the status of your order, the estimated arrival date, the brand’s return policy, and the brand’s contact information. If you have any questions about your order, tap “Support” to send an email to Spring Concierge.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>I placed an order but didn't receive a confirmation email. 
        Did my order go through?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Every time you place an order, you will receive a confirmation email from Spring. 
        <br/>
        If you didn’t receive an email, first check your Spam folder. If the confirmation email isn’t there, your order may not have been processed. 
        <br/>
        You can double-check by going to “My Orders” in the “Me” tab on your iOS device, or by tapping “Orders” in the left navigation menu on your Android device. If your order is listed there, everything is great — you can see the status of your order at the top of the screen. If you don’t see your order under “My Orders,” we're sorry to say it was not processed. Please contact us and we’ll make things right!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>I received credits on Spring. How do I apply them to my order?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Any Spring credits in your account will be automatically applied to your next order. If your credits exceed the total cost of your purchase, the remaining credit balance will be kept in your account.

      <h3 class='question'>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet.

        1. Go to the “Me” tab at the bottom right.
        <br/>

        2. Tap the Settings icon (it looks like a gear) located in the top right corner.
        <br/>

        3. Scroll down to “Preferences” and tap on “Payment Methods.” You can add a new payment method or change your existing payment info.
        <br/>

        You can also add a new credit card any time you make a purchase. After you tap the “Buy” button and select a size, tap the plus sign on the Payment line. You can add a new card here and it will be saved to your Payment Methods.
        <br/>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>How do I change my billing details?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        To change your billing address, please remove your current credit card, then add it back using your updated billing address. (We realize this isn’t the most elegant experience, and we are working to update it ASAP!)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>Is my credit card information secure?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Spring processes payments with Stripe, a secure PCI Level One compliant service provider. Spring never touches your payment information or holds any sensitive information. Once your order has been placed, Stripe requests authorization from your bank. Your account will not be charged until your order has shipped.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>Why was I charged multiple times?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Spring processes payments with Stripe, a secure PCI Level One compliant service provider. When you place an order, Stripe requests authorization from your bank, and you will not be charged until your order has shipped. 
        <br/>
        Stripe will reauthorize your credit card every 6 days until your order ships, which is why you may see a second charge on your account. Not to worry, this pending charge will fall off shortly! Stripe will stop reauthorizing your card as soon as your item ships.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>When will I receive my refund?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Because Spring is a marketplace, each brand sets its own return policy. Therefore, refund processing time varies by brand.

        Contact  and we will request an update on your refund status immediately.

      <h3 class='question'>How can I find and follow brands on Spring?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        This is one of our favorite features. There are hundreds of brands to love and discover in three easy steps:
        BRANDS
        1. For iPhone, tap the ‘Brands’ tab at the bottom of your Spring screen. For Android, tap the left menu navigation and select ‘Brands.’
        2. Search by brand name or explore brands by category.
        3. When you see a brand that you want to follow, simply tap the plus button next to the brand's name.
        If you want to see more from any brand, tap on the brand name to visit their Spring Shop. Tap the 'Follow' button in the brand's Spring Shop to add them to your personalized feed 
        BROWSE
        You can also discover new brands in the Browse tab, where you can explore by category from all brands on Spring - whether or not you follow them.
        You can tap into any post to learn more about the product and tap the brand logo to visit their Spring Shop and 'Follow' them.
        If you can’t find a brand you are looking for, they might not yet be Spring. But we'd love to know about them! Send an email to brandrequest@shopspring.com - discovering new brands is one of our favorite things to do.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>How can I find a specific product?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        There are a few ways to find a product on Spring:
        1. If you know the brand name, tap the 'Brands' tab and search for the brand by name.  Click into their Spring Shop by tapping on their logo, and browse all the products to find the one you're looking for.
        2. You can also browse products by category. Simply go to the 'Browse' tab and select from Women’s, Men’s, Lifestyle or Beauty, then select the product category and browse all products available in that category.
        If you don’t see the product you're looking for, the brand may not have posted it on Spring. Shoot us a note at Spring Concierge with the brand name, product name, and any other information and we’ll try to track it down for you!

        Simply love any item on Spring and it’s saved to view later. Just tap the Heart icon under the product image or double tap the image itself to love an item. To see your loved items you've saved, tap the 'ME' section on your iPhone, or the 'My Loves' tab on your Android. You can use this to save your items for later or collect all your favorites in one place.
