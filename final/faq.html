      <h3 class='question'>What is Spring?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Spring is a mobile app that enables you to shop and discover more than 800 amazing brands in one place, with free shipping on everything. Every day Spring is filled with new arrivals from brands including Levi’s, Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Opening Ceremony, Steven Alan, Everlane, Beyoncé, Warby Parker, 3.1 Phillip Lim, American Apparel, and hundreds more. 
        <br/>
        Spring is designed to be a marketplace where people and brands can connect — when you make a purchase, you are buying directly from the brand, and the brand sends its product directly to you. We just play matchmaker!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>How can I get Spring?</h3>

  <ul class='limit mt6 mb4 qa'>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>When will my order arrive?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        When you make a purchase on Spring, you are placing an order directly with a brand. Each brand offers its own shipping method, so the answer to “When will my order arrive?” is: It depends.
        <br/>
        When you place an order, you will receive a confirmation email from Spring. The brand will then process your order and ship the item to you directly. 
        <br/>
        You can view your order status in the “ME” tab on your iOS device, or in the left menu navigation under “Orders” on your Android device. Select an order to see the shipping method and estimated arrival date. You can also view the estimated arrival date in your confirmation email from Spring.

    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>Is my credit card information secure?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Spring's payment processor is Stripe - a secure PCI Level One compliant service provider. Spring never touches your payment information or holds any sensitive information. Once an order has been placed, Stripe then requests authorization from your bank. Your account will not be charged until your order has shipped.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>Why was I charged multiple times?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Spring is partnered with Stripe, a secure PCI level one compliant service provider to process payments.  When you place an order, Stripe will request authorization from your bank. You will not be charged until your order has shipped. Stripe will reauthorize your credit card every 6 days until your order ships, which is why you may see a second charge on your account. Not to worry, this pending charge will fall off shortly!
        Stripe will stop reauthorizing your card as soon as your item ships.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class='mt2'>
      <h3 class='question'>When will I receive my refund?</h3>
      <p class='answer mt1'>
        Because we are a marketplace, brands on Spring set their own return policy. Therefore, the refund processing time may vary by brand.
        Contact concierge@shopspring.com and we will request an update on your refund status immediately.
      </p>
    </li>
